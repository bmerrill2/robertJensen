      <p>Fashion Fades: Only Style Remains the Same</p>
      <p>Dressing well increases a healthy regard for who we are, where we have been, and what we can do. It supports an optimistic outlook and reflects our capacity to achieve. Dressing well is also aspirational – what we wish to become. And often overlooked: dressing well speaks to our respect for those around us.</p>
      <p>A superbly handcrafted, bench made necktie is a noted artistic expression of personal style, part of our aesthetic balance, our personal story of respect, honor, and effort.</p>
      <p>Wonderfully handmade neckwear compliments that optimism instilled by Bob’s parents, who taught to always do your best and do it with love. ROBERT JENSEN neckwear is imagined and designed on California’s Central Coast and realized by talented traditional artisans in Como, Italy, with passion, respect, and trust.</p>
