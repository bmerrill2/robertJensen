      <p>A message from the founder:</p>
      <p>Blessed with an unabashed “neckwear consciousness” all my life…bows early, “story boarding” of all my shirts and ties at twelve, and seeing “design” in everything around me. Off to college, Greek life, learning, getting the tradition: then, inspiring others to step up to quality and achievement; marriage, family, grad school, high-end retail, apprenticed to a neckwear legend, design career, serving and lifting others, gathering the talents of our well trained next generation and finally…the classic family neckwear business is born!</p>
